# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) & CLI Notes

## 📌 Key IAM Principles
- **Grant least privilege:** Give users only the permissions they need — _never more_.
- **Avoid using the root account** for everyday tasks.

---

## 👤 Creating an IAM User

1. **Create a user** (e.g., for an admin).
2. **Add the user to a group** (e.g., `Admin`).
3. **Set an account alias** (e.g., `mycompany-account`).
4. **Share login info**:
   - IAM Sign-in URL:  
     `https://<account-alias>.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`
   - Share **username** and **password** created.

## 🛡️ IAM Policy Structure

A policy is a JSON document with the following structure:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "PolicyID123",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "UniqueStatementID",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Username"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "192.0.2.0/24"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
🧩 Elements of a Policy Statement
Sid: Statement ID (optional)

Effect: Allow or Deny

Principal: Who this applies to

Action: AWS operations allowed or denied

Resource: What it applies to

Condition: When/under what circumstances

✅ Example AWS Managed Policy
IAMReadOnlyAccess: Grants read-only access to IAM.

🔐 IAM Password Policy & MFA
Enforce strong password policies.

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):

Something you know (password) + something you have (device).

Even if password is compromised, account is secure.

💻 AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)
Overview
Tool to interact with AWS via command line.

Script automation possible.

Open-source: AWS CLI GitHub

🔧 Setup Instructions
Go to IAM > Users > Security Credentials

Create Access Keys

Run the CLI config:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws configure
Enter:

Access Key ID

Secret Access Key

Region: ap-south-1

🧰 AWS SDK (Software Development Kit)
Programmatic access to AWS from within apps.

Language-specific libraries (JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, .NET, etc.)

🐚 AWS CloudShell
Browser-based shell with AWS CLI pre-installed.

⚠️ Not available in all regions — check availability.

🎭 IAM Roles for AWS Services
Some services (like EC2, Lambda) require permissions to act on your behalf. Use IAM Roles.

Common Roles:
EC2 Instance Role

Lambda Execution Role

CloudFormation Role
